## 🍻 **Liar’s Bar — Custom Card + Revolver Game**

A high-risk bluffing game where royalty lies, jokers deceive, and only the bold survive!

---

### 🃏 **Deck Setup:**
Use a custom 20-card deck:
- 6 × **Aces** (lowest)
- 6 × **Queens**
- 6 × **Kings** (highest)
- 2 × **Jokers** (wild — can act as **Ace**, **Queen**, or **King**)

> 💡 Jokers are **Jack of All Trades** — you decide their value when needed.

---

### 👥 **Players:**
- 4 players: Each round, all players get 1 card.
- The rest of the cards remain hidden/unseen.

---

### 🎲 **Game Flow:**

#### 🔸 **1. Deal Phase:**
- Shuffle the 20-card deck.
- Deal 1 card face-down to each player.
- Players peek at their own cards.

#### 🔸 **2. Table Declaration:**
- Each round is themed:
  - **King’s Table**
  - **Queen’s Table**
  - **Ace’s Table**
- These themes don’t change mechanics but add flair. (Or use them to assign dares.)

#### 🔸 **3. Turn Order:**
- Randomize or rotate turn order.
- On your turn, you can:
  - **Keep your card**, or
  - **Swap blindly** with the next player

> 🃏 If you have a **Joker**, you can **pretend** it’s any card — but only **once per round**.

#### 🔸 **4. Calling "Liar":**
- If someone offers to swap, you can accept **or** say:
  > "Liar!"
  - Both reveal cards.
  - **Lower card loses**.

> (Ace < Queen < King — Jokers are whatever you *claim*, but can be challenged.)

#### 🔸 **5. Round End:**
- After all swaps, everyone reveals.
- The **lowest card loses the round**.

---

### 🔫 **Punishment: The Revolver**
The losing player must "shoot" the revolver:
- Simulated 6-chamber revolver
- 1 bullet, 5 blanks
- **Click** = safe  
- **BANG** = out for the round

> You can adjust revolver to 4 or 5 chambers for more risk. All fair and random.

---

### 🧮 **Scoring:**
- Last survivor each round = **1 point**
- First to 5 points wins the game

---

### 💡 **Tips:**
- Use the **Jokers** wisely — they can save you or trick others!
